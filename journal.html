Journal Entry 1:

So far, I’ve really enjoyed CS1. I’ve learned about divs, classes, effects(i.e. hover affect), basic styling of divs, adding images from the internet, attaching links to my website, etc. In the process of making my website, I learned many new things. I like that our projects are pretty much independent; I learn best this way. However, it’s really nice that if we need help, we can always ask a peer, teacher or even reference the videos. Currently, I’m working on my website. I’ve decided to set my website, Journal, About Me and Projects page, on a typewriter. Using a typewriter gives me a widerange of options for my next individual pages. I’ll most likely base it off that theme. Sometimes I find it frustrating to format certain divs the way I want to, but, when I do figure it out, it feels good. In the next couple weeks, I’d like to finish my homepage for my website(background, divs, extra-add ons), and make headway on my other pages. I’m really excited to finish this project!

Journal Entry 2:

Since my last journal entry, I’ve learned how to position fonts/divs, change colors in certain areas(background), modify internet images and update my website online. I’ve learned how to do many of these things through the creation of my own website. While adding an extra feature, I learn how to execute a new skill. Currently, I’m adding finishing touches to my home page. I’m considering adding more icons to my typewriter or background. Furthermore, I’m building out my other pages(journal, projects, etc) in a similar format to one another. Soon, in the next few weeks, I aim to complete the final construction of my website. I'm really excited to interact with my finished website. I look forward to the start of our next project: the digital present!

Journal Entry 3:

This week I learned how to make animations. Since I’m going to be making a tennis related project for my digital gift, learning how to code animations(i.e. making a ball bounce) was really helpful. Although I had minor difficulties, I’d say I accomplished this pretty seamlessly. For this project, there was nothing that really frustrated me. In respect to the checklist, I’d say I can do most things. However, in the future, I may want to schedule a lab to add a sound to my digital present. When the ball hits the “ground”(image of tennis court), I’d like it to make a pop sound. For this week, my goal is to try to work on/finish my digital present!

Journal Entry 4:

So far, I’ve learned predominantly about variables and functions. Variables can be created when indicated as either var, let or const depending on the case. They are essentially digital objects that stuff is done to. Some functions can be created while others are already built in the framework of javascript(i.e. eventListeners). There purpose is to carry out an objective/”action”. They are basically input-output machines. You start off with something and end up with something else. For a function to print out its output, the coder needs to type console.log(). My codesketch essentially operates off a “click”. The inner construction of my codesketch is almost entirely composed by a function. It spawns a set div, a knife, when the page is clicked on. The functions records the x and y coordinates of the click, then creates the div in the same exact location.

Journal Entry 5:

First, my code establishes a function and a name: makeCookie. It opens the code up for further development inside it. The next sentence essentially creates the object/variable that the function is gonna operate on/input/change. After that the cookie is added and further styled(height and width). The following lines provide what happens when the variable, cookie, is clicked on. Finally, the addition of Set Interval runs the code such that it generates, cookies, every second(1000 miliseconds). Now, if the code doesn’t work you can debug. To do this, you can check whether the images you used have been placed in your folder. You can also make sure that you’ve spelt everything correctly and that you’ve run the function. Finally, you can check the console to make sure your function is running correctly.

Journal Entry 6:

In my Tom and Jerry interactive game, the mouse(jerry) moves to a random location, every 700 milliseconds; I did this with the help of a Math.random function. Tom, on the other hand, moves on hover(“mousemove”). Finally, an alert pops up when Tom makes contact with Jerry’s div, saying game over. My goal in creating this project was to create a fun game that simulated the general idea of Tom and Jerry, Tom chasing Jerry. Not only did I enjoy creating this game, but I also think that it’s a fun game to play.

Journal Entry 7: 

My data representation project adopts a multi-page design layout. Each page uses different color combinations, in terms of background color and text. Moreover, I changed the text type between pages, by styling the text at the top. Next, for each page, I ran a function loop that produced a certain amount of money per whatever I made the page say. For example, if the page said, “Aces hit”, I’d “create” bills below corresponding to how much money Roger Federer would make per ace hit. Now, the tricky part about this was that I didn’t want the code to produce an infinite amount of bills(variables) because I wanted to correspond to the money-made. First, I created a function that allowed me to produce bills I created a second function called “counting” and created a variable in the first function called “counter”. I basically said that if “counter” reached a certain value (value changed between slides), then the function would stop running. Furthermore, I added an EventListener that allowed me to “change the variable”(from pic of money to Roger Federer) on click. I enjoyed making this data representation project a lot because it was really fascinating to me how much money Roger Federer makes for even the smallest things; comparing the numbers(dollar amounts) was really interesting, especially in a visual way.

Journal Entry 8:

Project Euler was a really fun, interesting project. Before even starting to code, Alex and I brainstormed our ideas on a white board. We wanted to find all multiples of 3 and 5 below 1000, then subtract the sum of these numbers by the sum of all multiples of 15. If we didn't do this, we would arrive at an inaccurate sum, as we would be adding repeats of the same number(since 3 and 5 share common multiples). We coded everything according to plan, but then we ran into a problem. The sum wasn't being computed accurately; there were a variety of different sums being shown and none of them were correct. Now, to debug the code and solve the problem, we spent a while, discussing our issues with Molly and other students. Eventually, we realized that we had simply put the wrong variable in the wrong place in the code. Such a trivial mistake caused very significant problems. This taught us to learn to double-check, and not overlook anything(even the smallest things!) when coding.
