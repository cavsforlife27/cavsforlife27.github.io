Journal Entry 1:

So far, I’ve really enjoyed CS1. I’ve learned about divs, classes, effects(i.e. hover affect), basic styling of divs, adding images from the internet, attaching links to my website, etc. In the process of making my website, I learned many new things. I like that our projects are pretty much independent; I learn best this way. However, it’s really nice that if we need help, we can always ask a peer, teacher or even reference the videos. Currently, I’m working on my website. I’ve decided to set my website, Journal, About Me and Projects page, on a typewriter. Using a typewriter gives me a widerange of options for my next individual pages. I’ll most likely base it off that theme. Sometimes I find it frustrating to format certain divs the way I want to, but, when I do figure it out, it feels good. In the next couple weeks, I’d like to finish my homepage for my website(background, divs, extra-add ons), and make headway on my other pages. I’m really excited to finish this project!

Journal Entry 2:

Since my last journal entry, I’ve learned how to position fonts/divs, change colors in certain areas(background), modify internet images and update my website online. I’ve learned how to do many of these things through the creation of my own website. While adding an extra feature, I learn how to execute a new skill. Currently, I’m adding finishing touches to my home page. I’m considering adding more icons to my typewriter or background. Furthermore, I’m building out my other pages(journal, projects, etc) in a similar format to one another. Soon, in the next few weeks, I aim to complete the final construction of my website. I'm really excited to interact with my finished website. I look forward to the start of our next project: the digital present!

Journal Entry 3:

This week I learned how to make animations. Since I’m going to be making a tennis related project for my digital gift, learning how to code animations(i.e. making a ball bounce) was really helpful. Although I had minor difficulties, I’d say I accomplished this pretty seamlessly. For this project, there was nothing that really frustrated me. In respect to the checklist, I’d say I can do most things. However, in the future, I may want to schedule a lab to add a sound to my digital present. When the ball hits the “ground”(image of tennis court), I’d like it to make a pop sound. For this week, my goal is to try to work on/finish my digital present!

Journal Entry 4:

So far, I’ve learned predominantly about variables and functions. Variables can be created when indicated as either var, let or const depending on the case. They are essentially digital objects that stuff is done to. Some functions can be created while others are already built in the framework of javascript(i.e. eventListeners). There purpose is to carry out an objective/”action”. They are basically input-output machines. You start off with something and end up with something else. For a function to print out its output, the coder needs to type console.log(). My codesketch essentially operates off a “click”. The inner construction of my codesketch is almost entirely composed by a function. It spawns a set div, a knife, when the page is clicked on. The functions records the x and y coordinates of the click, then creates the div in the same exact location.

Journal Entry 5:

First, my code establishes a function and a name: makeCookie. It opens the code up for further development inside it. The next sentence essentially creates the object/variable that the function is gonna operate on/input/change. After that the cookie is added and further styled(height and width). The following lines provide what happens when the variable, cookie, is clicked on. Finally, the addition of Set Interval runs the code such that it generates, cookies, every second(1000 miliseconds). Now, if the code doesn’t work you can debug. To do this, you can check whether the images you used have been placed in your folder. You can also make sure that you’ve spelt everything correctly and that you’ve run the function. Finally, you can check the console to make sure your function is running correctly.
