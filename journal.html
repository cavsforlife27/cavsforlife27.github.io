Journal Entry 1:

So far, I’ve really enjoyed CS1. I’ve learned about divs, classes, effects(i.e. hover affect), basic styling of divs, adding images from the internet, attaching links to my website, etc. In the process of making my website, I learned many new things. I like that our projects are pretty much independent; I learn best this way. However, it’s really nice that if we need help, we can always ask a peer, teacher or even reference the videos. Currently, I’m working on my website. I’ve decided to set my website, Journal, About Me and Projects page, on a typewriter. Using a typewriter gives me a widerange of options for my next individual pages. I’ll most likely base it off that theme. Sometimes I find it frustrating to format certain divs the way I want to, but, when I do figure it out, it feels good. In the next couple weeks, I’d like to finish my homepage for my website(background, divs, extra-add ons), and make headway on my other pages. I’m really excited to finish this project!

Journal Entry 2:

Since my last journal entry, I’ve learned how to position fonts/divs, change colors in certain areas(background), modify internet images and update my website online. I’ve learned how to do many of these things through the creation of my own website. While adding an extra feature, I learn how to execute a new skill. Currently, I’m adding finishing touches to my home page. I’m considering adding more icons to my typewriter or background. Furthermore, I’m building out my other pages(journal, projects, etc) in a similar format to one another. Soon, in the next few weeks, I aim to complete the final construction of my website. I'm really excited to interact with my finished website. I look forward to the start of our next project: the digital present!
